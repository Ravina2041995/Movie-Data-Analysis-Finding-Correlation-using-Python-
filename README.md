## Background Information:

In this project I have used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about movie data and to fine correlation between different features and gross profit. The data contains more than 13k rows of name,	rating,	genre	year,	released,	score,	votes,	director,	writer,	star,	country,	budget,	gross,	company	runtime.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- Finding Correlations in the Data.
- Finding which features is having maximum correlation to gross profit and which is having least impact.
